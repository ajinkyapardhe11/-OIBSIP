            <h1><span class="text-primary">The History</span> of Hotel</h1>
            <p>The Taj Mahal Hotel was commissioned by Jamsetji Tata and opened its doors to guests on 16 December 1903.
                An oft-repeated story concerning the reasoning behind the 
                construction of the hotel was Tata being refused admission into Watson's Hotel, 
                as it was reserved for Europeans. However, the validity of this has been
                challenged by writer Charles Allen, who wrote that Tata was unlikely to care 
                about such a slight to the extent that he would construct a new hotel.
                Instead, Allen writes, the Taj was built at the urging of editor of The Times of India
                who felt a hotel "worthy of Bombay" was needed and as a "gift to the city he loved" by Tata.
